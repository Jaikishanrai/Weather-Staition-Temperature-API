# Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features for creating web applications
#                                                                                            in the Python Language.
# Flask looks for templates in the template's directory, which is called templates, so the name is important.
# Make sure youâ€™re inside the flask_app directory and run the following command to create the template's directory.
# good practice to use __name__
# render_template -->   renders the template with information and serves it to the browser.
# @app.route("xyz")---> App routing is used to map the specific URL with the associated function that is intended to
#                                                                                                  perform some task.
# app.run(debug=True)---> Running the app in debug mode will show an interactive traceback and console in the browser
#                                                                                              when there is an error.
# app.run(debug=True, port=5001 )---> flask apps always run on port 5000 by you can change the port of the app
# str(station).zfill(6)----> add zeros to the string
