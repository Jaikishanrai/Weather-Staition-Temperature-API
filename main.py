# Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features for creating web applications
#                                                                                            in the Python Language.
# Flask looks for templates in the template's directory, which is called templates, so the name is important.
# Make sure youâ€™re inside the flask_app directory and run the following command to create the template's directory.
# good practice to use __name__
# render_template -->   renders the template with information and serves it to the browser.
# @app.route("xyz")---> App routing is used to map the specific URL with the associated function that is intended to
#                                                                                                  perform some task.
# app.run(debug=True)---> Running the app in debug mode will show an interactive traceback and console in the browser
#                                                                                              when there is an error.
# app.run(debug=True, port=5001 )---> flask apps always run on port 5000 by you can change the port of the app
# str(station).zfill(6)----> add zeros to the string

parse_dates=['    DATE']----> We can use the parse_dates parameter to convince pandas to turn things into real
 datetime types. parse_dates takes a list of columns (since you could want to parse multiple columns into datetimes ).

.squeeze() ----> This method is most useful when you don't know if your object is a Series or DataFrame, but you do know
 it has just a single column. In that case you can safely call squeeze to ensure you have a Series. A specific axis to
  squeeze. By default, all length-1 axes are squeezed.
